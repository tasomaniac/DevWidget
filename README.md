What
----

Android app widget for developers to have control over their apps really quickly on their homescreen.

Features include: 
- Launching
- Uninstalling
- Go to app details
- Clear data
- Deeplink launching (Coming soon)
- Automated clear data (Coming soon)

**Note:** This project/idea was inspired by [Tony Owen's DevDrawer Android app](https://github.com/tunitowen/DevDrawer). This widget has been really really helpful to me for long years. But unfortunately, it's not been maintained anymore and it has many crashes that prevents its usage. I decided to build another one from scratch with more modern design and more modern tools for my own needs. 

Why
---

Although the problem discovered above is not huge, it is missing in the Android ecosystem. And I couldn't find anything doing this. So I wrote one. :)

Although it is not the most useful app, it does save you when you stuck in a browser where you want the native app to be open. I hope you find it useful.
